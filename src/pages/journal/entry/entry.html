    <h2>Dear diary,</h2>
    <p>
      Today I created the first version of my new colegend prototype.

      Jane also seemed mad all day because she could tell that Sarah was being fake nice to her. I hate being in the
      middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah’s been my friend since forever, and Jane is my new friend,
      and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings! But I think that Jane is right about Sarah. I think Sarah sometimes
      gets too dramatic about things. She’s being kind of a brat about all of this, but I don’t want to tell her that to
      her face, she’d never forgive me.
