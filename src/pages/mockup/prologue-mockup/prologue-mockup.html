  <span class='story-initial-letter'>O</span>nce upon a time . . .
  somewhere in Germany on a special Sunday afternoon...
  Not knowing what exactly to expect, a courageous person has decided to take action and leap into a new world.
  A magical one it turns out...
  Where both heroes and demons can celebrate.
  Where matters of right or wrong are cast aside in favor of mutual interest.
  Where instead of defending their point of view, they name their needs and ask for support.
  Where loneliness is merely an option that can be chosen at will.
  Where every person is a designer and author of life.

  The time has come to open eyes and heart to a new life experience and a new way of community.

  Our fellowship started out small: First there was the seed of an idea, slowly becoming a small plant, stretching and drinking in the sunlight.
  With every member that joins, we grow into a bigger tree with even more delicious "fruit".
  We already thank you for your courage and energy and wish you, Eraldo, a happy harvest.

  [You start to wonder what he? or she? is talking about.]
  [Feeling as if you open your eyes for the first time, you take a look around.]

  You stand in a forest at a clearing and right in the middle of it, you see a marvelously growing tree. . .
